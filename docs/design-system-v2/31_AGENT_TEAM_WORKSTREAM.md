# 31 — Design System V2 Agent Team Workstream

## Purpose

Shared operating board for the autonomous EDARA Design System V2 team.

Authoritative branch: `design-system-v2-development`.
`main` remains frozen until explicit owner approval.

Authorities:
- Product quality: `32_DESIGN_SYSTEM_NORTH_STAR.md`
- Test/evidence: `33_TEST_AND_VALIDATION_POLICY.md`
- Communication: `34_AGENT_TEAM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md`

## Team and state machine

| Role | Responsibility | Cadence | Product code | Merge | Deploy |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Product Design Director | System identity, architecture, next slice, design quality | every 2 hours | No | No | No |
| UI Production Engineer | Implement/repair the single active UI slice | hourly | UI-only | No | No | No |
| Design QA | Independent exact-head review | hourly | No | No | No |
| Development Integrator | Merge GREEN-DEV PR and advance queue | hourly | No feature work | Development only | No |

`BACKLOG -> READY -> IN_PROGRESS -> REVIEW -> GREEN-DEV -> DONE`

Exceptional state: `BLOCKED`.
Only one implementation slice may be active. A role with nothing actionable must no-op.

## Repository-native communication

Before material action every role reads Team Memory, all four role states, the Decision Log, this workstream, issue #27, and the active PR. Each role owns only its own state file. Integrator updates Team Memory after successful merge. Issue #27 is the concise event stream.

## GitHub Actions / preview policy

Hosted GitHub Actions remain forbidden while quota protection is active. Focused tests are still authored. Normal development evidence is exact-head `AGENT-REVIEW: GREEN-DEV` + `SOURCE_REVIEW_PASS` + an honest execution label. A known build/type failure blocks integration.

Vercel preview remains owner-requested only. Scheduled agents never merge to `main`.

## Current integrated baseline

Product UI is integrated through `DS2-REPORT-012`.

Latest product integration:
- PR: `#59 — DS2-REPORT-012: converge Customer Health responsive collection`
- Exact reviewed PR HEAD: `f92e25a4ad6afa0303235d8971c20e028fe8a9c5`
- Squash merge commit: `7935e461e3c212eb187fe56bbb14ebe3e427f874`
- Evidence: `AGENT-REVIEW: GREEN-DEV` + `SOURCE_REVIEW_PASS` + `TESTS_AUTHORED_NOT_EXECUTED`
- Product Design: `PASS — NO DESIGN-SYSTEM BLOCKER` on the same exact HEAD
- Runtime/preview/release evidence: not claimed

The development branch includes semantic foundations, responsive shell/navigation/form/collection/action patterns, Dashboard V2, Customers migrations, Sales list/form/detail foundations, Inventory list/transfer migrations, Procurement list/form-shell migrations, Finance overview/detail foundations, HR operational-task/admin collection proofs, Field Activities list/create-edit proofs, Work create-task form convergence, Work Hub shared view-mode selector convergence, Supervisor Work shared KPI summary convergence, Reports shared route-level sub-navigation convergence, Reports shared date-preset selector convergence with hardened `SegmentedControl` geometry, Reports shared native `DateField` convergence for custom dates, Reports Overview KPI-summary layout convergence onto shared `MetricGrid`, Product Performance and Customer Health responsive detail-collection convergence via `ResponsiveCollection + Card + KeyValueList`, Geography analysis-level convergence onto shared `Select -> Field`, and shared domain-agnostic `ChartPanel` proven across Sales, Receivables, Churn Risk and Product Performance analytical sections.

### REPORT012 system result

- Customer Health section `تفاصيل العملاء — أعلى 50 حسب القيمة` now uses the existing presentation-only `ResponsiveCollection + Card + KeyValueList` grammar for Tablet/Mobile while Desktop retains the dense semantic five-column table with `th scope="col"`;
- exactly one renderer is mounted per device and the same unchanged Customer Health row truth is used across Desktop, Tablet and Mobile;
- blocked/loading/empty/ready precedence and copy, Trust/Freshness behavior, customer identity/fallback, recency/frequency/90-day monetary/status meaning, top-50/order truth and the `stats.total > 50` informational footer remain caller-owned and unchanged;
- no shared component API/CSS widening, second report/page, backend/schema/RPC/query/cache/calculation/permission/RBAC/RLS/routing/export/print/business/deployment/workflow change entered the slice.

## Current single READY slice

### DS2-REPORT-013 — Churn Risk responsive detail-collection convergence
Status: `READY`
Owner role for immediate next action: UI Production Engineer

Representative surface:
- `src/pages/reports/ChurnRiskPage.tsx`
- section `تفاصيل العملاء — مرتب: معرض للخطر أولاً` only.

System-pattern intent:
- deepen the already-proven Reports responsive collection grammar on the actual current six-fact RFM row contract, rather than invent a second data shape or continue low-value chart-shell repetition;
- Desktop preserves the current dense semantic comparison table while Tablet/Mobile deliberately compose the same caller-owned row truth with the existing presentation-only `ResponsiveCollection + Card + KeyValueList` grammar;
- exactly one renderer is mounted for the active device; hidden duplicate Desktop/Mobile surfaces are not acceptable;
- shared components remain presentation-only and must not absorb risk classification, RFM score, recency, frequency, monetary, customer identity, query or trust semantics.

In scope:
- migrate only the blocked/loading/empty/ready customer detail collection under `تفاصيل العملاء — مرتب: معرض للخطر أولاً` into the established responsive orchestration while preserving the section shell/header and Trust/Freshness cluster;
- **Desktop:** retain the existing six columns in the existing order: `العميل`, `التصنيف`, `RFM Score`, `أيام منذ آخر شراء`, `تكرار (90 يوم)`, `قيمة (90 يوم)`, with existing compact density, values and row order; add proper column-header semantics (`th scope="col"`) without changing content;
- **Tablet/Mobile:** render exactly the same six facts through `ResponsiveCollection + Card + KeyValueList`; customer identity remains the card lead and preserves the current display rule: resolved `customer_name` when present, otherwise the existing truncated `customer_id` fallback only; do not invent an additional visible ID or new content;
- preserve `RiskBadge` exactly for `risk_label`, the exact `rfm_score` value, `RecencyCell` exactly for `recency_days`, the exact `frequency_l90d` value with `×`, and `fmtCur(row.monetary_l90d)` exactly for 90-day monetary value;
- preserve current blocked precedence and exact blocked copy (`بيانات الخطر محجوبة` / `snapshot_customer_risk يحتاج تشغيل ناجح أولاً`), the five `SkeletonCard` rows at height 44 for loading, and exact empty copy `لا توجد بيانات — شغّل watermark sweep أولاً`;
- preserve current page-level SystemHealth/trust/freshness behavior exactly; no new table-level state semantics, calculation, sorting or customer-risk interpretation;
- preserve existing LTR treatment for RFM/frequency/monetary/recency facts inside the Arabic-first RTL composition;
- rely on shared semantic Card/KeyValueList styling for dark mode; long Arabic customer names must wrap safely with `min-width: 0`/safe wrapping rather than introduce page-level horizontal drift.

Device/state/accessibility acceptance:
- **Desktop:** dense semantic table remains the management comparison surface and does not regress into cards; local table overflow remains contained to the table region;
- **Tablet:** intentional shared card/key-value composition, with the five non-identity facts suitable for a compact two-column `KeyValueList` and safe Arabic wrapping;
- **Mobile:** single-column shared cards with no horizontal table dependency;
- exactly one device renderer is mounted at a time through `ResponsiveCollection`;
- blocked/loading/empty states remain singular and exact; ready-state content is not duplicated in the accessibility tree;
- Desktop headers expose column-header scope; Tablet/Mobile fact anatomy keeps shared `dl/dt/dd` semantics through `KeyValueList`;
- no new interactive control, focus path, keyboard behavior, hover dependency or touch target is introduced.

Focused test intent:
- Desktop/Tablet/Mobile renderer selection and exactly-one-renderer behavior;
- exact blocked/loading/empty precedence and copy, including five 44px loading skeletons;
- exact six-field Desktop header order and row/card fact mapping;
- current customer-name versus truncated-ID fallback behavior, with no invented extra identity field;
- unchanged `RiskBadge`, `rfm_score`, `RecencyCell`, `frequency_l90d` and `fmtCur(monetary_l90d)` semantics;
- semantic Desktop `scope="col"`, Tablet/Mobile `KeyValueList` anatomy, LTR numeric treatment and long-Arabic containment.

Explicit exclusions:
- REPORT010 pie `ChartPanel` and all chart behavior;
- KPI grid and all report filter/date controls;
- SystemHealthBar/trust/freshness redesign or new state semantics;
- `RiskBadge` / `RecencyCell` semantic redesign;
- `CustomerRiskRow` type, query hooks, RPC/service contracts, calculations, RFM/churn classification, sorting/order, backend/schema/cache, permissions/RBAC/RLS, routing/export/print/business behavior;
- any invoice-count, total-spend, average-invoice or other facts not present in the current `CustomerRiskRow` contract;
- any other Reports/Analytics page or second responsive collection;
- any material API/CSS change to `ResponsiveCollection`, `Card` or `KeyValueList`;
- Settings/Admin, remaining Work/Field debt, Global convergence and deployment/workflow changes.

Stop condition:
- if implementation requires material shared API/CSS widening, simultaneous hidden duplicate device surfaces, a new data field/calculation, or any functional/data/trust semantic change, mark `DS2-REPORT-013` `BLOCKED` and return to Product Design rather than expanding the PR.

## Product migration roadmap

The Product Design Director may decompose an item further, but exactly one dependency-safe implementation slice becomes READY at a time.

## Integrator development gate

Before merge:
- exact current PR HEAD has `AGENT-REVIEW: GREEN-DEV`;
- reviewer records `SOURCE_REVIEW_PASS` and honest test evidence;
- no known build/type failure;
- no unresolved material blocker or current `BLOCKING` role-state contradiction;
- PR base is `design-system-v2-development`;
- diff contains no forbidden backend/business/query/permission/deployment change.

After merge:
- completed slice becomes DONE with reviewed/merge SHA and evidence;
- exactly one next dependency-safe roadmap item becomes READY;
- Integration State and Team Memory are synchronized;
- no preview deployment;
- no merge to `main`.

## End condition

The autonomous workstream continues until the North Star completion definition is met across major modules, shared component grammar, device behavior, RTL/dark/state/accessibility convergence and final controlled runtime review.
