# 31 — Design System V2 Agent Team Workstream

## Purpose

Shared operating board for the autonomous EDARA Design System V2 team.

Authoritative branch: `design-system-v2-development`.
`main` remains frozen until explicit owner approval.

Authorities:
- Product quality: `32_DESIGN_SYSTEM_NORTH_STAR.md`
- Test/evidence: `33_TEST_AND_VALIDATION_POLICY.md`
- Communication: `34_AGENT_TEAM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md`

## Team and state machine

| Role | Responsibility | Cadence | Product code | Merge | Deploy |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Product Design Director | System identity, architecture, next slice, design quality | every 2 hours | No | No | No |
| UI Production Engineer | Implement/repair the single active UI slice | hourly | UI-only | No | No |
| Design QA | Independent exact-head review | hourly | No | No | No |
| Development Integrator | Merge GREEN-DEV PR and advance queue | hourly | No feature work | Development only | No |

`BACKLOG -> READY -> IN_PROGRESS -> REVIEW -> GREEN-DEV -> DONE`

Exceptional state: `BLOCKED`.
Only one implementation slice may be active. A role with nothing actionable must no-op.

## Repository-native communication

Before material action every role reads Team Memory, all four role states, the Decision Log, this workstream, issue #27, and the active PR. Each role owns only its own state file. Integrator updates Team Memory after successful merge. Issue #27 is the concise event stream.

## GitHub Actions / preview policy

Hosted GitHub Actions remain forbidden while quota protection is active. Focused tests are still authored. Normal development evidence is exact-head `AGENT-REVIEW: GREEN-DEV` + `SOURCE_REVIEW_PASS` + an honest execution label. A known build/type failure blocks integration.

Vercel preview remains owner-requested only. Scheduled agents never merge to `main`.

## Current integrated baseline

Product UI is integrated through `DS2-REPORT-027`.

Latest product integration:
- PR: `#75 — DS2-REPORT-027: Churn Risk filter-control field convergence`
- Exact reviewed PR HEAD: `2beb65da6a2b46f3e1bf831471c55b9a5bbf8f5a`
- Squash merge commit: `d9a1fb373142cac8c9f7f1b7545d340f99298f8a`
- Evidence: `AGENT-REVIEW: GREEN-DEV` + `SOURCE_REVIEW_PASS` + `TESTS_AUTHORED_NOT_EXECUTED`
- Product Design: `PASS — NO DESIGN-SYSTEM BLOCKER` on the same exact HEAD
- Runtime/preview/release evidence: not claimed

The development branch includes semantic foundations, responsive shell/navigation/form/collection/action patterns, Dashboard V2, representative Customers/Sales/Inventory/Procurement/Finance/HR/Field/Work migrations, Reports route/date/filter convergence, shared `ChartPanel`, shared `MetricGrid`, shared V2 `Field` controls in representative report headers, and responsive detail-collection proofs using `ResponsiveCollection + Card + KeyValueList` while preserving dense Desktop comparison and caller-owned business truth.

## REPORT027 system result

- Churn Risk's page-header risk classifier now uses the existing shared V2 `Select` / `Field` grammar instead of page-local native styling.
- Its single `بتاريخ:` as-of-date control now uses existing shared `DateField` / `Input` / `Field` grammar.
- Exact `riskLabel ?? ''`, clearing to `undefined`, option order/values/copy, `asOfDate`, `max={today}`, date onChange and both customer-risk hook inputs remain caller-owned and unchanged.
- Arabic/RTL composition and accessible naming/label association improve through the shared Field contract; existing wrapped header remains contained across Mobile/Tablet/Desktop and shared touch sizing remains authoritative through Tablet.
- The five-card KPI summary, ChartPanel/pie/trust/SystemHealthBar, responsive detail collection, Desktop table, Tablet/Mobile cards, loading/blocked/empty behavior and all business/query/permission/backend semantics remain unchanged.
- No shared API/CSS/token/breakpoint widening or deployment/workflow change occurred.

## Current single READY slice

### DS2-REPORT-028 — Profit Dashboard summary metric-grid convergence
Status: `READY — BOUNDED`
Owner role for immediate next action: UI Production Engineer.

Representative surface:
- `src/pages/reports/profitability/ProfitDashboard.tsx` → only the four-card KPI summary currently wrapped by local `report-grid`.

System intent:
- replace only that KPI-summary wrapper with existing shared `MetricGrid columns={4}`;
- keep all four existing report-domain `MetricCard` instances caller-owned and unchanged in meaning, order and content;
- use the already-proven canonical metric composition: Desktop `4` columns, Tablet `2`, Mobile `1`, with `minmax(0, 1fr)` containment and no ordinary horizontal overflow;
- strengthen system coherence by removing one more local metric-layout implementation without moving profitability semantics into shared components.

Acceptance boundary:
- preserve exact KPI order: `صافي الإيراد بعد المرتجعات` → `المبيعات (تكلفة البضاعة)` → `إجمالي الربح (التشغيلي)` → `المصروفات التشغيلية والرواتب`;
- preserve exact values and calculations, including `net_revenue`, `cogs`, `gross_profit`, the operating+payroll expense sum, and the existing gross-margin secondary value/copy;
- preserve exact `isLoading ? '...'` behavior for all four metrics; do not invent a new skeleton/state contract in this slice;
- preserve all existing `overviewTrust` status / last-completed / stale props, `domain="profit_overview"`, icons and the local `PackageIcon`;
- preserve Arabic/RTL wrapping, mixed Arabic/Latin content and large numeric containment through the existing `MetricCard` + `MetricGrid` contracts;
- no new interaction semantics are introduced; accessibility remains presentational and the grid must not create focus/keyboard behavior;
- focused tests should protect `data-columns="4"`, exact KPI order and preservation of the existing loading/trust/secondary-value wiring; evidence remains `TESTS_AUTHORED_NOT_EXECUTED` unless an approved execution route actually runs them.

Explicit exclusions:
- the separate `report-grid-2` / `صافي الربح النهائي` highlight card and its net-profit-margin presentation;
- page title/header composition, `ReportFilterBar`, date-range state, `branchId`, `useProfitSummary` query inputs, `useSystemTrustState`, `useTrustForComponent`, or any data/query/cache/calculation semantics;
- `MetricCard`, `MetricGrid`, shared CSS/tokens/breakpoints/APIs or any new five-column metric contract;
- all other profitability/report pages, tables, charts, filters, drawers, export/print behavior and responsive-detail work;
- DB/RPC/services/RBAC/RLS/permissions/routing/validation/workflows/backend/business semantics;
- Vercel, preview branches, GitHub Actions, hosted CI and `main`.

Stop rule:
- if implementing this wrapper-only convergence requires any shared-contract widening or functional/business semantic change, mark REPORT028 `BLOCKED` rather than widening the PR.

## Product migration roadmap

The Product Design Director may decompose an item further, but exactly one dependency-safe implementation slice becomes READY at a time.

### A. Golden flows

### J. Settings / Administration
- `DS2-ADMIN-001` Users/roles/settings/audit surfaces — `BACKLOG`

### K. Global convergence and cleanup
- `DS2-GLOBAL-001` Global style debt and inline-style reduction — `BACKLOG`
- `DS2-GLOBAL-002` Dark mode / RTL / long Arabic / numeric stress pass — `BACKLOG`

## Integrator development gate

Before merge:
- exact current PR HEAD has `AGENT-REVIEW: GREEN-DEV`;
- reviewer records `SOURCE_REVIEW_PASS` and honest test evidence;
- no known build/type failure;
- no unresolved material blocker or current `BLOCKING` role-state contradiction;
- PR base is `design-system-v2-development`;
- diff contains no forbidden backend/business/query/permission/deployment change.

After merge:
- completed slice becomes DONE with reviewed/merge SHA and evidence;
- exactly one next dependency-safe roadmap item becomes READY;
- Integration State and Team Memory are synchronized;
- no preview deployment;
- no merge to `main`.

## End condition

The autonomous workstream continues until the North Star completion definition is met across major modules, shared component grammar, device behavior, RTL/dark/state/accessibility convergence and final controlled runtime review.
